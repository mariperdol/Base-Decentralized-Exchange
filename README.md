Base Decentralized Exchange
📋 Project Description
Base Decentralized Exchange is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency exchange built on the Base network. The platform enables peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens with automated market making and liquidity provision.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Solidity 0.8.0
Framework: Hardhat
Network: Base Network
Standards: ERC-20
Libraries: OpenZeppelin, Uniswap V2 Router

🚀 Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mariperdol/Base-Decentralized-Exchange.git
cd base-dex
2. Install dependencies
npm install
3. Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile
4. Run tests

💰 Features

Core Functionality:
✅ Token swapping
✅ Liquidity provision
✅ Automated market making
✅ Trading fees
✅ Order book functionality
✅ Real-time trading

Advanced Features:
Automated Market Making - Constant product formula (x*y=k)
Liquidity Pools - Multiple token pair support
Trading Fees - Configurable fee structure
Slippage Protection - Minimize price impact
Real-time Charts - Trading visualization
Advanced Orders - Limit orders and stop-losses


🛠️ Smart Contract Functions

Core Functions:
swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) - Execute token swap
addLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) - Add liquidity to pool
removeLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 liquidityAmount) - Remove liquidity from pool
getQuote(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn) - Get trading quote
getPoolInfo(address tokenA, address tokenB) - Get pool information
getTradingFee() - Get current trading fee

Events:
TokenSwapped - Emitted when token swap occurs
LiquidityAdded - Emitted when liquidity is added
LiquidityRemoved - Emitted when liquidity is removed
FeeUpdated - Emitted when trading fee is updated
PoolCreated - Emitted when new pool is created


📊 Contract Structure

Pool Structure:

struct Pool {
    address tokenA;
    address tokenB;
    uint256 reserveA;
    uint256 reserveB;
    uint256 totalSupply;
    uint256 fee;
    uint256 lastUpdate;
}

Trade Structure:

struct Trade {
    address trader;
    address tokenIn;
    address tokenOut;
    uint256 amountIn;
    uint256 amountOut;
    uint256 fee;
    uint256 timestamp;
}


⚡ Deployment Process

Prerequisites:
Node.js >= 14.x
npm >= 6.x
Base network wallet with ETH
Private key for deployment
ERC-20 tokens for trading pairs
Deployment Steps:
Configure your hardhat.config.js with Base network settings
Set your private key in .env file
Run deployment script:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base


🔒 Security Considerations

Security Measures:
Reentrancy Protection - Using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
Input Validation - Comprehensive input validation
Access Control - Role-based access control
Price Manipulation - Anti-manipulation mechanisms
Gas Optimization - Efficient gas usage patterns
Emergency Pause - Emergency pause mechanism

Audit Status:
Initial security audit completed
Formal verification in progress
Community review underway
