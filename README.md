🛠️ Smart Contract Functions
Core Functions:
swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) - Execute token swap
addLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) - Add liquidity to pool
removeLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 liquidityAmount) - Remove liquidity from pool
getQuote(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn) - Get trading quote
getPoolInfo(address tokenA, address tokenB) - Get pool information
getTradingFee() - Get current trading fee
Events:
TokenSwapped - Emitted when token swap occurs
LiquidityAdded - Emitted when liquidity is added
LiquidityRemoved - Emitted when liquidity is removed
FeeUpdated - Emitted when trading fee is updated
PoolCreated - Emitted when new pool is created
